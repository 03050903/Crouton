Operations are very simple:\r\n\r\n* `mvn -f library/pom.xml clean package` will build `jar` library;\r\n* `mvn clean package` will build `jar` library and sample application `apk` package;\r\n* `mvn -f library/pom.xml clean install` will put Crouton in your local Maven repository.\r\n\r\nAfter putting Crouton in the repository you can add it as a dependency.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <artifactId>crouton</artifactId>\r\n  <version>1.6</version>\r\n  <groupId>de.keyboardsurfer.android.widget</groupId>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contribution\r\n\r\nThis section is subject to changes.\r\n\r\n### Pull requests welcome\r\n\r\nFeel free to contribute to Crouton.\r\n\r\nEither you found a bug or have created a new and awesome feature, just create a pull request.\r\n\r\nIf you want to start to create a new feature or have any other questions regarding Crouton, [file an issue](https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/Crouton/issues/new).\r\nI'll try to answer as soon as I find the time.\r\n\r\n### Formatting\r\n\r\nFor contributors using Eclipse there's a formatter available at the [download section](https://github.com/downloads/keyboardsurfer/Crouton/Crouton_Eclipseformatter.xml).\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce merging pains on my end, please use this formatter or format your commit in a way similar to it's example.\r\n\r\nIf you're using IDEA, the Eclipse Formatter plugin should allow you to use the formatter as well.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n* [Apache Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)\r\n\r\n## Attributions\r\n\r\nThe name and the idea of [Crouton](https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/Crouton/blob/master/library/src/de/keyboardsurfer/android/widget/crouton/Crouton.java) originates in a [blog article](http://android.cyrilmottier.com/?p=773) by Cyril Mottier.\r\n\r\nThe Crouton logo has been created by [Marie Schweiz](http://marie-schweiz.de).\r\n\r\nThe initial version was written by [Benjamin Weiss](https://plus.google.com/117509657298845443204) at [Neofonie Mobile GmbH](http://mobile.neofonie.de).\r\n","name":"Crouton"}
